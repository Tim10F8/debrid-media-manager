# Debrid Media Manager

Start building your media library with truly unlimited storage size!

## What is this?

Do you want a movie and TV show library that has unlimited size? Consider using a Debrid service, like Real-Debrid, AllDebrid, or TorBox. These services work like a shared storage space for downloading torrents. You can download as much as you want without worrying about storage limits, because the files are shared among all users. You only "own" the file when you download it to your account.

These Debrid services also offer a WebDAV API that lets you connect your media library to different devices or software — like your own cloud drive for media.

You can connect your media library to players like [Infuse](https://firecore.com/infuse) (Mac, iPhone, Apple TV, iPad) or media server software like Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin. This way, your media library can be accessed and played from anywhere!

[Debrid Media Manager](https://debridmediamanager.com/) is a **free** and open source web app that makes it easy to download movies and TV shows directly to your Debrid library. Build and curate your media collection without ever worrying about storage limits.

## Features

This builds on top of the amazing service brought by [Real-Debrid](http://real-debrid.com/?id=11137529), [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/?uid=1kk5i&lang=en), and [TorBox](https://torbox.app/subscription?referral=74ffa560-7381-4a18-adb1-cef97378c670).

### Library management

See all your torrents in one page, sort them by name, size, or quality score. It groups torrents by title and helps you delete duplicates. It can show you failed or slow downloads and delete them.

### Torrent search

Add content to your library by searching for torrents. It detects what you already have downloaded and currently downloading in your library.

### Movie and TV show info pages

Browse detailed information about movies and TV shows including cast, crew, trailers, and related content. View comprehensive person filmography pages to explore an actor's or director's complete work.

### Stremio integration

Use DMM as a Stremio addon to stream your debrid library directly through Stremio. Includes a Cast addon for sharing your library streams.

### Trakt integration

Sync with your Trakt watchlist, collection, and custom lists to easily add content to your library.

### Share your library and mirror other libraries

## FAQ

### I just don't know where to start or why do I need this?

[Read the guide here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13enrfVXcGEEd0Yqb0PBTpGYrIvQpSfeIaAMZ_LiBDzM/edit).

### But with Kodi and FEN and Stremio being available, why would I ever need this?

If you want some level of curation on your library. I personally prefer watching only 100+ GB remux releases. Don't ask me about -arr apps and/or Usenet. I also came from that setup and found it too time consuming to maintain.

### How does it monitor what's in your library?

It doesn't do any sort of monitoring. It gets that information when you open the Library page and caches it in your browser's local storage.

### When I share my library, is it linked to my account's identity?

No. It's completely anonymous. What's shared are 3 things: filename, magnet hash, file size. It's not even stored in any database. The data is compressed and stored in the URL. A "webpage" is then created over at https://hashlists.debridmediamanager.com that loads this list of magnet hashes.
